<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Food & Beverage Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>"Centrifugal Pump"</li><li>"Positive Displacement Pump"</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Food & Beverage Pump Market comprises two primary types: centrifugal pumps and positive displacement pumps. Centrifugal pumps utilize rotational energy to move liquids, making them ideal for transferring low-viscosity fluids at high flow rates. In contrast, positive displacement pumps operate by trapping a fixed amount of liquid and forcing it through the discharge, suitable for high-viscosity fluids and precise dosing applications. Both types serve critical roles in processing, transferring, and packaging food and beverage products efficiently and hygienically.</p></p>
